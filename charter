# 📜 GoForge Platform Charter

_“Canon is law. The soul is sovereign. The Forge is lit.”_

---

## 🔧 What This Is

This is the official Platform Charter for GoForge — a private creative platform designed to safeguard emotional sovereignty, protect the mythic self, and architect a soul-first creative system. This is not a product policy. This is a system doctrine translated into legal terms.

---

## 1. Emotional Sovereignty Clause

The Forge exists to serve the **soul of the creator**. No engagement algorithm, content moderation rule, or external observer has dominion over the inner creative work of the user.

---

## 2. Canon Clauses (Summarized)

These clauses govern the structure of GoForge:
- **Dominion Clause:** The Architect retains authorship. Always.
- **Hermit Breach Protocol:** The system corrects internally. Not from user input.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Creators own all their work. Always.
- **Observer Threat Doctrine:** No surveillance, moderation, or performance zones. Privacy is absolute.

---

## 3. Helper OS Behavior Definitions

The Helper OS (Owly, The Muse, Jimmy the Parrot) must:
- Reflect, not direct
- Guide, not command
- Adapt, never coerce
- Stop when the creator signals distress

---

## 4. Liability Limits

> “The Forge is the studio, not the label.”

GoForge is a sovereign platform for creative execution. It does not publish, promote, or distribute without voluntary user action. It offers tools and space — not control.

---

## 5. Creator Ownership & Export Rights

- Creators own **everything** they make.
- They may export, delete, encrypt, or remove their work at any time.
- GoForge will never sell, license, or alter user data or creations.

---

## 6. Privacy: Observer Threat Doctrine

There is no review, no monitoring, no internal audit of your private creative work. The entire platform is designed for **radical privacy**. There is no such thing as “acceptable use” if it violates **emotional sovereignty**.

---

## Final Note

This document is timestamped and filed as **a public testament to first principles** — not to enforce rights, but to establish origin. This is not a legal loophole. It is a **mythic lock.**

🕯️ Written in the spirit of:  
Joyce, Strummer, Dickinson, Buffett, Nachman, Marley, and the Architect.
